  <ul class="search-result">
    <li *ngFor="let human of humans$ | async" >
      <!--The $ is a convention that indicates humans$ is an Observable, not an array.
         Since *ngFor can't do anything with an Observable, use the pipe character (|) followed by async.
         This identifies Angular's AsyncPipe and subscribes to an Observable automatically so
         you won't have to do so in the component class.-->
